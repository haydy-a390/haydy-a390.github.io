                    <h2>Mini Project 1</h2>
                    <p>This project involves GitHub. I partnered with fellow classmates to gain experience with working on
                        projects with other people on GitHub and using controls such as "forking," "branching," "pull requests,"
                        "commits" and "push."</p>

                    <h2>Mini Project 2</h2>
                    <p>In this project I teamed up with a classmate to build a website together using GitHub and
                        Webstorm. Throughout
                        this process, I have learned about how to work with other people, how to edit, and the steps
                        needed to take so
                        that my partner can see the changes I've made.</p>

                    <p>This project involved me exercising the use of GitHub, Webstorm, Jekyll, Mailchimp, and
                        Bootstrap to create
                        a portfolio webpage that includes a short description of myself, my resume, and

                    <h2>Axure: Interactive Mockup</h2>
                    <p> In this project, I used the program Axure to create an interactive mockup of an app for an
                        iPad4 that is
                        used to count the amount of calorie intake and keep track of any diet plan the user is on.
                        It can also be
                        used to plan out the exercise and have the ability to add or change it.</p>

                    <h2>Axure: Dance App</h2>
                    <p>In this project, I, along with my fellow groupmates, used Axure to build an app the we have
                        been designing
                        and researching for. We interviewed many dancers and some non-dancing people in order to
                        gain insight and
                        later feedback to better improve on our design. The app allows a user to interact with dance
                        communities in
                        their area or of their interest. It allows them to easily communicate with other members and
                        take their
                        dance videos and allow them to smoothly send it to the captain of the team in order to
                        receive feedback on
                        their progress, which can also be seen on the app. The captain can comment on a specific
                        portion of the
                        video and resend it to the user for them to view.</p>
