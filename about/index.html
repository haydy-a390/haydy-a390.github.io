<h1>About</h1>
<p class="lead">
    Hello, my name is Haydy Abdalla. I am currently attending NJIT and am majoring in Information Systems. I have
    experience with html, css, python. Recently this year I have also worked with Webstorm, Git, GitHub, and
    boilerplate. I did not suddenly become interested in this field in a single moment; it slowly grew over
    time. Before, when I was on the other side of the stage, a part of the audience, a user who simply consumed
    things that IT technicians, software developers, web developers etc., created, I didn't think much about what
    went on behind the scenes and simply enjoyed the cool features my smartphone. I was amazed by how coding could
    be used to build almost anything and how anyone could do it if they applied themselves and worked to learn the
    coding required to accomplish their goal. The only limit is your own motivation and perseverance. As the time
    passes by, the society we live in becomes more and more reliant on technology and it will continue. I want to
    be a part of that world and be personally involved in the monumental movements that are being made to change
    the society we are living in, for the present and what it means for the future.
